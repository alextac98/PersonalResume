\project{SmallKat Major Qualifying Project}{2018-Present}{is a quadrupedal robotic platform designed for research and development of multipedal robotic systems. SmallKat is 3D printed, open source, and contains fully custom electronics. I am developing the high-level software, including footstep planning, path planning, forward/inverse kinematics, machine vision, and networking systems for off-platform debugging for my Major Qualifying Project with 2 other students.

\project{Project Maverick}{2015-Present}{is an award-winning omni-directional robotic system that provides mobility for people with walking disabilities. The drive system allows the user to move in any direction using 4 steering and 4 driving electronically synchronized motors, creating the same degrees of motion as an able person. It was designed, built, and programmed as a personal project, initially with Java and then converted to ROS (C++ \& Python).

\project{Project Drogo}{2017}{is a wearable embedded system accompanied by a smart-phone app designed to assist elderly people through post-hip surgery recovery. It combines 2 goals of post-surgery medicine: preventing prohibited motions and guiding the user through physical therapy and rehab. Developed on a team of 4 students as a part of the hackathon Health Hacks RI, where it received 1st place. To learn more, please visit \href{https://www.alextac.com/drogo}{www.alextac.com/drogo}}
\project{Project Pather}{2017}{is a kiosk mapping software developed to provide directions to Bringham and Women’s Hospital visitors. It has contextual search as well as the capability to send directions to users via text message or email. It is written in Java and JavaFX, with a SQL backend, and was developed on an 8-person team for a school project.
